    "prose": "This map shows the three, generally accepted “migrant streams” in which farmworkers tend to travel to harvest crops seasonally. Each stream begins and ends in one of three “sending states,” Florida, Texas or California, where farmworkers will return at the end of the season. The streams are fluid, adjusting to regional shifts, with the Texas stream being the most divergent, with some workers ending up in Washington state or Florida.",
